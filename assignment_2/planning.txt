Analyzation:
	- UMAP

Correlations:
	- Heatmap

Class Imbalances
	How to find them?
		- Use Python to count classes and see if they are evenly divided.
	How to fix them?
		- Smote.
		- Data augmentation.
		- Remove from Major class if alot of data in minor class.

Unessecary Features:
NA-Values:


Dimensionaly Reduction:
	How do i do it?
		PCA:
			Identify patterns i ndataset and the distill the variables down to their most
			important features.
			Remove redundant data.

			Optimizes the describing variances.
			Curse of dimensionality.

F1 Score:
	What does f1 score mean how to weigh it.

Things to study:
	Feature selection.
	F1 Score.

2.1 Data analytics:
	Easy to do just count the classes and remove NA values,
	Find correlations, use UMAP cause it is cool.


2.2 Model:
	Choose Classifications algorithm for example SVM. Get f1 score by comparing
	true values with predicted values. 
	Different kinds of classification algorithm:
		- Logistic Regression
		- SVM
		- Decision Tree

2.3 Data Analytics:
	Solve class imbalances by using smote to create syntetic oversampling, by creating
	variations of minor class. Depending on if we have alot of data in the minor class
	we could instead just remove values from major class.

	Use PCA and show what features are unessecary. Heatmap on correlations.
	Does the dimensionreduction with PCA improve your result?
	Test to do pure feature selection: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/feature_selection.html 

2.4 Model:
	Try FBeta values 0.5, 1.2 for minor class
	Use 2 different classification alghorithms and compare results.
		- SVM
		- Logistic Regression
		- KNN
